1)  Prepare your system.
    Install Maven2 from http://maven.apache.org/ .
    Install Python2.6 from http://www.python.org/ .


2)  Run 'mvn' to setup and build the project.
    Maven takes care of several tasks:
     * It installs all tools.
     * It creates configuration files.
     * It creates a shortcut to build the project with scons.
     * It runs scons to build the project.

3)  From now on use 'scons.bat' (or 'scons.sh' on Linux) to build the project.
