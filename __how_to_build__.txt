1)  Prepare your system.
    Install the current stable version of python from http://www.python.org/ .
    At the time of writing this is Python2.7 .


2)  Setup and build the project.
    Change to the folder with this textfile. Run the 'mbs/mbs' script to setup
    and build the project.
    
    PLEASE NOTE: This step depends on the location of your python installation.
    If python was installed in 'C:\Python27', run the command
    'C:\Python27\python.exe mbs\mbs'.
    
    The setup script takes care of several tasks:
     * It installs all tools.
     * It creates configuration files.
     * It creates a shortcut to build the project with scons.
     * It runs scons to build the project.


3)  Build the project after a successful setup.
    The 'setup.py' script creates 2 batch files:
     * 'scons.bat' for Windows systems and
     * 'scons.sh' for Linux systems
    These scripts just build the project and skip the setup phase. Run the
    command 'scons.bat' (or 'scons.sh' on Linux) to do this.
    
    Of course it is also possible to execute the 'mbs/mbs' script to setup and
    build the project. The only drawback is that it takes a little bit longer
    than the plain build without the setup phase.
